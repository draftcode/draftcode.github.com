        <p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my mentor gave me some advice that
I've been turning over in my mind ever since.</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever you feel like criticizing any programmer,&quot; he told me, &quot;just
remember that all the programmers in this world couldn't write a program that
you've wrote.&quot;</p>
<p>He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a
reserved way, and I understood that he meant a a great deal more than that. In
consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up
many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran
bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality
when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in my workplace
I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy the secret
bugs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought -- frequently
I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by
some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the
horizon; for the poorly structed codes of young programmers, or at least the
snippets of the code they write, are usually copied and pasted from untrusted
sources. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little
afraid of missing somthing if I forget that, as my mentor snobbishly
suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense and the knowledge of the
fundamental computer science are parcelled out unequally at the beginning of
the work.</p>
