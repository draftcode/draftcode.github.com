        %a(href="https://github.com/draftcode/sandal") Sandal: Fault aware modeling language
        (2013-2014)

      %p
        Design and implement a modeling language that is aware about faults. It can eﬀectively check the fault tolerance of systems like RRRSpec. Implemented in Go.

      %h3 Develop an Android Application (Team leader, April 2012 - December 2012)

      %p

        Concentration: Model checking and Fault tolerance. Takuo Watanabe Lab.

      %h4 Full-Automatic Exhaustive Fault-Injection on Software Models of Message-Passing Systems

      %p
        Fault tolerance of distributed systems can be effectively verified by model checking and fault injection, but its process is highly error-prone. I proposed a way to solve this problem by adding a language support to modeling languages, which is a common approach in programming languages.

      %h3 BS Computer Science Tokyo Institute of Technology (March 2012)

      %p
        Concentration: Context-oriented programming. Takuo Watanabe Lab.

      %h4 An Implementation Method of Context-Oriented Programming in Objective-C

      %p
        Context-oriented programming is a programming method that enables us to define behaviors that depend on the program's execution context. I proposed an implementation method of Context-oriented programming in Objective-C.
